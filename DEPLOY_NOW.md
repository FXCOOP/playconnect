### Step 2: Create PostgreSQL Database (3 min)

6. Once ready, click on your database
7. In the "Connections" section, **COPY** the **"Internal Database URL"**
   - It looks like: `postgresql://playconnect:XXX@dpg-XXX-a.oregon-postgres.render.com/playconnect_XXX`
   - **Keep this window open - you'll need it in Step 3!**

---

### Step 3: Create Web Service (5 min)

2. Click **"New +"** → **"Web Service"**

### Step 4: Watch the Deploy (5 min)

Render will now:
1. ✅ Clone your GitHub repo
2. ✅ Install dependencies (pnpm install)
3. ✅ Generate Prisma Client
4. ✅ Build Next.js (~3 min)
5. ✅ Start the server

**Watch the logs in real-time!** You'll see:
```
Installing dependencies...
Generating Prisma client...
Building Next.js...
✓ Compiled successfully
Starting server...
```

When you see **"Your service is live 🎉"** at the top, it's ready!

---

### Step 5: Initialize Database (2 min)

Your app is live but the database is empty. Let's add tables and demo data!

1. In your web service page, click the **"Shell"** tab (top menu)
2. Wait for the shell to load (~10 seconds)
3. Run these commands **one by one**:

```bash
# Create database tables
pnpm prisma db push
```

Wait for: `✅ Database schema created`

```bash
# Add demo data (10 families, 20 children)
pnpm db:seed
```

Wait for: `✨ Seed completed successfully!`

You'll see:
```
✅ Created 40 interests
✅ Admin user created
✅ Created 10 families with 20 children
✅ Created "Lego Builders Club" group
```
